This is the collecion of excercises and projects that I have done as part of the Udemy's  course **Complete Python bootcamp : Go from zero to hero in python3**

### Dependancy
If *Anaconda* package is installed by default then you wont need to install any other modules. 
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
### Milestone project 1 - Tic tac toe
Program alternates between two players to get the input (**X** & **O**) and checks if there is match between same symbols either : *horizontally*, *vertically* or *diagonally*.
